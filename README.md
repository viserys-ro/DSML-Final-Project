Room Occupancy Estimation Dataset


Dataset Overview
The Room Occupancy Estimation Dataset is a publicly available dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains sensor data collected from a room to estimate occupancy (whether the room is occupied or not). The dataset is suitable for classification tasks, particularly binary classification, where the goal is to predict room occupancy based on environmental sensor readings.
